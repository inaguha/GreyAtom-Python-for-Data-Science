### Project Overview

 The project deals with Objects in Python and how to use them in a real-life Student Management System (for example: updating, removing, appending and performing arithmetic operations on the set of given data).


### Learnings from the project

 Through this hands-on project, I thoroughly learnt using the built-in type Objects in Python in various ways by managing the Student database.
